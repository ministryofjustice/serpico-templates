{"id": 1, "title": "Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error", "overview": "Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to dangerous buffer underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move down the stack where they otherwise might not have access in a normal buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values, and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Choose a language which is not subject to these casting flaws.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Design object accessor functions to implicitly check values for valid sizes. Ensure that all functions which will be used as a size are checked previous to use as a size. If the language permits, throw exceptions rather than using in-band errors.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Error check the return values of all functions.
