Another common practice is to add an extension or change the name of the original directory to signify that it is a backup (examples include '.bak', '.orig', '.backup', etc.).<paragraph></paragraph>During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to locate backup directories by adding common extensions onto directories already discovered on the webserver. By analysing the response headers from the server they are able to determine if a backup directory exists. These backup directories can then assist in the compromise of the web application.<paragraph></paragraph>By utilising the same method, the tool was able to discover a possible backup directory.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Do not keep obsolete versions of directories under the virtual web server root.<paragraph></paragraph>When updating the site, delete or move the directories to a directory outside the virtual root, edit them there, and move (or copy) the directories back to the virtual root.
