{"id": 1, "title": "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (&amp;#x27;Race Condition&amp;#x27;)", "overview": "This can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or modifying important state information that should not be influenced by an outsider. A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc. A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related: Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution. Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource. A race condition exists when an interfering code sequence can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single x++ statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x). The interfering code sequence could be trusted or untrusted. A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the program; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable program.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring. Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:When using multithreading and operating on shared variables, only use thread-safe functions.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use atomic operations on shared variables. Be wary of innocent-looking constructs such as x++. This may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read, followed by a computation, followed by a write.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a mutex if available, but be sure to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-412.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Avoid double-checked locking (CWE-609) and other implementation errors that arise when trying to avoid the overhead of synchronization.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Disable interrupts or signals over critical parts of the code, but also make sure that the code does not go into a large or infinite loop.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use the volatile type modifier for critical variables to avoid unexpected compiler optimization or reordering. This does not necessarily solve the synchronization problem, but it can help.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
